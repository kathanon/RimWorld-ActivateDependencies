	<description>Makes it easier to activate the dependencies of a mod when you have many in the list.

Adds several new features to the "Mods" dialog:
A button that enables all installed dependencies of active mods, and triggers autosort (shown in the image above).
A checkmark control on the right-hand side, that allows enabling or disabling the selected mod without having to find it in the list.
A button that enables all installed dependencies of the selected mod (by the "Workshop page" and "Unsubscribe" buttons, only visible if there is anyting for it to do).
You can now enable and disable mods from the dependencies list, just like in the mods list.

All of the controls in the list above only handles installed but not active mods, they will not help you install any missing ones. However, when clicking on a dependency that is not installed, it will now open in Steam rather than in the browser.
